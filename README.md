# BattleTank
Section 4 in the Udemy Complete Unreal Creator course. 
## Acknowledgements
Thanks to the UnrealCourse team for putting together this awesome course which really digs into the meat of what makes Unreal Engine work!
An open world PvP and PvE tank battle game.

## Specific project details
All commits are labeled edu_xx (indicating commit number) in the development process (which follows along with the course). All additional commits are labeled dev_xx as I explore some additional gameplay elements and make the game unique. 

## Assets and materials
All assets and materials that are not proprietary to the Unreal Course will be provided. I highly recommend going through this excellent course if you would like to learn the actual mechanics of the engine. This repo will just provide a look into some of the possibilities that can be built on the bones of the game mechanics.
